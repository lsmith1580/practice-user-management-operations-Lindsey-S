I practiced creating a table called users in MySQL and inserting values into that table, 
as well as updated values in the table, deleting users from the table, and practiced various 
select queries to find different data in the table depending on certain conditions. I found it 
most challenging to think of novel select queries that weren't shown as an example in the lesson
and would also make sense logically to that one would need to look up data in the table based on
those conditions.
